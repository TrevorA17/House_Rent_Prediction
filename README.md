# House Rent Prediction
This project is designed to predict house rental prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms (BHK), size of the house, floor details, area type, locality, city, furnishing status, tenant preference, number of bathrooms, and point of contact. The project utilizes machine learning models, specifically Ridge Regression, to estimate the rent of houses in different localities. The dataset is pre-processed and cleaned before being used to train the model, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions. The model can be accessed via a Plumber API, which allows users to input house details and receive a predicted rent price in real-time. This system aims to assist in determining house rental costs based on a variety of influential factors, making it a valuable tool for homeowners, tenants, and real estate professionals.
